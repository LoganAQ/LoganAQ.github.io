      <b>Description:</b> This is a module from a leadership development program designed for 
      managers with little to no prior management experience. The program is most effective when delivered 
      live and in-person, but can also be successful virtually. This module focuses on coaching, and was developed
      using Powerpoint. The facilitator guide is included in the Notes section.
